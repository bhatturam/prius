\title{Get a mapping table between UniProt ID's and HGNC Gene Symbols from
genenames.org}
\usage{
getUniProtToHGNCSymbolMapping()
}
\description{
This function downloads data from genenames.org to create a mapping table
between Universal Protein Resource (UniProt) Identifiers to HUGO Gene
Nomenclature Committee; gene symbols - which are the default ID's used in this
package. This is particularly useful in the case of reactome data, in which
interactions as well as pathway membership use UniProt ID's.
