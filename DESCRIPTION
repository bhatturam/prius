From Differentiated Genes to Affected Pathways. bioRxiv, p.038901.
Description: An R package to analyse affected pathways in differential
expression experiments. The approach is to disturb  each node of a gene-gene
interaction network proportional to the observed expression from the experiment
and rank the pathways based on how much they are affected. The package currently supports
microarray data from Gene Expression Omnibus, PPI data from iRef and Reactome and pathways
from Reactome.
