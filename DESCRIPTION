Description: An R package to analyse affected pathways in differential
    expression experiments. The approach is to disturb each node of a gene-gene
    interaction network proportional to the observed expression from the experiment
    and rank the pathways based on how much they are affected. The package currently
    supports microarray data from Gene Expression Omnibus, PPI data from iRef and
    Reactome and pathways from Reactome.
